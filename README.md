# Decentralized-Exchange-for-BinnaDev
Launch a DeFi Exchange for Binna Dev tokens

- Build an exchange with only one asset pair (Eth/Binance Dev).
- The Decentralized exchange should take a fee of 1% on swaps.
- When a user adds liquidity, they are given Binna Dev LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens).
- BD_NFTs LP tokens are distributed in proportion to the amount of Ether the user is willing to contribute to the liquidity.Â
